## Purpose of our program

The purpose of our program is to implement a function similar to the "Make" function. The user is to run the program in four different possible ways, with two arguments at maximum, the "-r" and "-p" flags, a Makefile name, and target name. 

## How to compile the program

To compile the program have all of the code and header files in the "src" folder and the files named "Makefiles#" belong in the "test" folder, and the main test "Makefile" in "pa1". Open a terminal and go into the correct file directory ex. "user/.../Assignment1/pa1/src" and enter "gcc main.c" into the terminal to compile the program.

## What Exactly our Program Does

Our program takes a Makefile and reads the lines to be printed out and executed depending on the flags passed through the command line when runing the prorgam.

## Team names

Moti Begna, begna002 and Wally Lu, luxx0460

## Contribtions

Moti contributed a great deal towards working on the parsing helper function and the -r and -p flags. Wally assisted in debugging and revising for the -r flag conditions and wrote the execution portion (forking and execv) of the code for the condition of running the program without the flags.

Any helper functions were written by Moti and debugged/revised by Wally. 




```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
